## Development & Hosting

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed, and run
`npm install -g gulp` followed by `npm install` in the root directory.

For development and browser live-reloading, run `gulp`. To only build the
source files for hosting, run `gulp build`. Your web server should serve
static files from the `public` directory.
